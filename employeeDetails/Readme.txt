1. H2-Console is used as a databse here.
2. Use the below url to connect to H2-Console : jdbc:h2:mem:employee
3. Please note that as the data is persistent in the H2-Console so you must have to use some insert command to feed some data to it:
  Use this template - INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE(ID,ADDRESS,NAME) VALUES(value1,'value2','value3');
4. Important urls: 
   h2-console : http:localhost:8080/h2-console
